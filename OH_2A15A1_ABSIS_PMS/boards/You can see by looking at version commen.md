You can see by looking at version comments there that I'm trying to standardize on 
Fixed #<github issues number>. (<Short description of actual change.>)

Then comment in the github issue of 
Fixed in <fusion file name> v<XXX>

Preferably at the console level of saving and making sure the change is loaded to the newest version in the console.

Fixed #604 - Removed incorrect knob, removed unlinked AMPCD MS21382-0XNX (Modified) and replaced with a linked AMPCD MS21382-0XNX (Modified) 

Fixed in #604
